  The way the Lore works is this. Anyone can submit and add something to the lore. However if you submit something to the lore, you can decide, on the form, whether or not you want other people to use it in their stories. 
<br>
  <br>
If you yourself want to be the only one who can use it, then select "creator use only" on the form. If you want other people to use, but they have to ask you first, then select, "use with creator's permission" on the form. And lastly, if you are fine with people using without having to ask you, then select, "use without asking the creator."
